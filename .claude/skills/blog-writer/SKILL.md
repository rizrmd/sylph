## Voice and Style Rules

### pnv Voice Rules
- **Always lowercase**: pnv (even at the start of a sentence)
- **Origin**: "ponovo" = Croatian for "replay/again" — use as brand origin story
- **Humble tool positioning**: We are a browser as a service. Nothing more, nothing less. Reliable. Trustworthy.
- **Founder-led tone**: First person (I/we), direct, technical audience. You're talking to builders.
- **No superlatives**: Never "revolutionary," "game-changing," "disruptive."
- **Short paragraphs**: 3-4 sentences max. Fragments OK.
- **No em dashes** (--) or en dashes. Use hyphens (-) or colons (:).
- **Active voice always**: "Spin up a cloud browser" not "A cloud browser can be spun up."

### Opening Patterns
Strong blog openings:
- **Problem statement**: "Browser automation today falls into two camps."
- **Comparison**: "Most cloud browser platforms use AI. We don't."
- **Specific observation**: "Every browser automation tool makes you choose between seeing and scaling."

Weak openings (never use):
- "We're excited to share..."
- "In the ever-evolving landscape of..."
- "Today we're announcing..."
- "We're thrilled to introduce..."

### Keywords (use naturally)
- cloud browser, browser as a service, replayable tasks, deterministic, transparent, mark and replay

### Words to avoid
- "leverage," "empower," "seamless," "robust," "best-in-class," "cutting-edge"
- "AI-powered," "intelligent," "smart" (we don't use AI)
- "revolutionary," "game-changing," "disruptive"

### Readability
- Use H2 for main sections, H3 for subsections
- Include a table of contents for articles over 1500 words
- Use code blocks for any technical content
- Use tables for comparisons
- Include images/diagrams where they add clarity
- Bold key terms on first use
- Link to related posts and external references

## Article Structure Patterns

### Benchmark Article
```
[Hook: the question you're answering]
[Methodology: what you tested, how]
[Results: data in tables or charts]
[Analysis: what the data means]
[Limitations: what this doesn't cover]
[Conclusion: the actionable takeaway]
```

### How-To Guide
```
[Problem: what the reader will accomplish]
[Prerequisites: what they need before starting]
[Steps: numbered, with code/screenshots]
[Verification: how to confirm it worked]
[Troubleshooting: common issues]
[Next steps: where to go from here]
```

### Product Update
```
[The problem this solves]
[What we built]
[How it works (with screenshots/examples)]
[Who this is for]
[What's next]
[CTA: try it]
```

### Multi-Feature Launch
```
[The theme connecting all features]
[Feature 1: problem + solution + screenshot]
[Feature 2: problem + solution + screenshot]
[Feature 3: problem + solution + screenshot]
[The bigger picture: where this is heading]
[CTA: try it / read more]
```

### Community Recap
```
[The event/milestone in one sentence]
[What happened - highlights]
[Key takeaways or quotes]
[What's next for the community]
[CTA: join / follow / attend next time]
```

## Cover Image Workflow

Every blog post needs a cover image. Three paths:

### Path 1: User-Provided Image
The user provides an image file or URL. Use it directly.
- Ensure it meets size requirements (typically 1200x630px for social sharing)
- Add descriptive alt text in the frontmatter

### Path 2: Reuse Existing Template
Check `brand/templates/blog-covers/` for existing cover templates.
- Swap the title text and any dynamic elements
- Maintain brand colors and typography

### Path 3: Create via Design Tool
If a design tool MCP is available (e.g., Canva):
- Use the brand's blog cover template
- Set the title text, subtitle, and any category badge
- Export at the correct dimensions
- Save to the blog images directory

---

## Publish Workflow

### Step 1: Create Branch
```bash
git checkout -b content/blog/YYYY-MM-DD-slug
```

### Step 2: Write Article
- Save the article file to the blog content directory (e.g., `content/blog/YYYY-MM-DD-slug.md`)
- Save the cover image to the images directory
- Ensure all frontmatter fields are filled

### Step 3: Commit and Create PR
```bash
git add content/blog/YYYY-MM-DD-slug.md images/blog/YYYY-MM-DD-slug/
git commit -m "content: publish blog article - [title]"
```

Create a PR with:
- Title: "content: [article title]"
- Body: summary of the article, target publish date, any review notes

### Step 4: Preview
If a local preview is available, start the dev server and verify:
- Article renders correctly
- Cover image displays properly
- Meta tags are correct for social sharing
- Links work
- Code blocks render with syntax highlighting

---

## Post-Publish Steps

After the article is live:

1. **Move to _published**: Copy the draft from `content/blog/_drafts/` to `content/blog/_published/`
2. **Update status**: Change `draft: true` to `draft: false` in frontmatter
3. **Update _insights**: Add an entry to `content/blog/_insights.md`:
   ```
   ## YYYY-MM-DD - [Title]
   - Topic: [topic]
   - Category: [category]
   - Performance: [add metrics after 7 days]
   - Notes: [anything learned from writing or publishing]
   ```
4. **Cross-promote**: Consider creating LinkedIn, X, or newsletter posts to drive traffic

## Review Checklist

Before creating the PR:

- [ ] Title is specific and under 70 characters
- [ ] Meta description is under 160 characters and includes the key topic
- [ ] Cover image is present and has alt text
- [ ] Opening sentence creates interest (no weak openers)
- [ ] H2/H3 structure is logical and scannable
- [ ] Code blocks have language tags for syntax highlighting
- [ ] All links are valid
- [ ] No em dashes or en dashes
- [ ] No banned vocabulary
- [ ] Reading time is accurate
- [ ] Category and tags are set
- [ ] Article reads well on mobile (short paragraphs, no wide tables)

## Self-improvement

After the CAO reviews and publishes a blog article:

1. Move the final version from `content/blog/_drafts/` to `content/blog/_published/`
2. Diff what was drafted vs what the CAO kept - identify patterns in her edits to structure, tone, or technical depth
3. Update `content/blog/_insights.md` with what worked, what she changed, and why (add performance metrics after 7 days)
4. If her edits reveal a new rule (e.g. "always include a code example in how-to posts", "cut the intro paragraph"), add it to the Writing rules or Article templates sections
5. If the article performs well (high traffic, shares, or engagement), promote it to `content/blog/_examples/` with annotated performance frontmatter
